# Oldtimer Pack (former Royal Pack)
This mod contains several new BattleMechs including 'mechs of the Royal SLDF regiments, as well as one Helm-tech class battlemech. Also, the mod allows you to buy Guardian ECM and Beagle Active Probe electronic systems in stores or find it in FP crates. Finally, it fixes the Hell of a Deal event, now it will be impossible to get a stupid weapon for a million of C-Bills there. This is an add-on for the BattleTech Extended: Commander's Edition 3025 mod (aka BEX) and requires it to be installed.

If you are looking for the Royal Pack mod, then this is it, simply due to the fact that there are quite a few 'mechs that don't belong to the SLDF Royal forces, the mod has been renamed.

# Compatibility:

Oldtimer Pack should be compatible with any mods and addons for BEX, provided that they don't change the internal design of battlemechs, i.e. don't add engines, actuators, etc. into mechlab. If you have installed any mod that changes the FullXotltables, then you'll have to manually transfer the data from the tables in this archive to those used in your mod assembly.

No new game required, the mod is compatible with current saves.

# Installation:
WARNING: Don't try to install the BTX CAC Compatibility version if you don't have the mcb's BTX CAC Compatibility mod with your BEX - the game may not start!
1) FOR USERS OF PREVIOUS MOD VERSIONS ONLY, i.e. RoyalPack users: open BT\Mods folder and delete RoyalPack folder. Only this, nothing more. If you don't have RoyalPack, but OldtimerPack folder is in your Mods directory, then I recommend to delete it too, but that's not too necessary, you can just replace old files.
2) Open BT\Mods folder and copy FullXotlTables and MechAffinity folders somewhere. Then open BT\Mods\BT_Extended and repeat the procedure with the itemCollections folder. These will be your backups in case something goes wrong.
3) Unpack the OldtimerPack archive and select the appropriate version depending on whether you have the mcb's CAC Compatibility mod installed or not. Each of the versions is in the corresponding folder, you won't be mistaken :)
4) Move or copy the folders BT_Extended, FullXotlTables, MechAffinity and OldtimerPack of the appropriate version to the BT/Mods directory and confirm the replacement of the files.
5) This is optional step, but it definitely won't hurt the installation. Open BT\Mods\ModTek folder and run modtekinjector.exe as administrator.
6) Launch BT and have fun. Make sure no error messages appear in the main menu.

Optional: Some 'mechs have shitty loadouts, design errors, and similar issues. The original versions of Oldtimer Pack add these 'mechs exactly as they are. However, if you don't like the fact that Spectors have five free armor points, Hoplite's weaponry is boring bullshit, and Pillager, in your opinion, lacks Vectored Thrust Kits to be the real horror at your battlefield, then you can install the Better Mechs patch. Just open the BetterMechs folder with the appropriate version from the archive, copy the OldtimerPack folder from there and paste it into BT\Mods with OldtimerPack folder already installed, confirming the replacement of the files. Don't forget: Better Mechs and Oldtimer Pack versions must match, i.e. for example, DO NOT install the Oldtimer Pack version for Stock BEX and patch it from the CAC version or vice versa.

Where to find?

ARC-2Rb, SHD-2Hb, WVR-7H, and PLG-3Z:
1) Find ComStar or Snords Irregulars and kick their asses. Perhaps you are lucky and the enemy will expose these battlemechs in battle;
2) Parts can be found in stores of Former SLDF systems, so check the stores during flights;
3) Parts can drop from FP crates, provided that the crate contains lostech items;
4) Finally, the parts can be found in the Hell of a Deal event reward crate. The event has been changed: now you can't receive weapons as a reward, only 'mech parts. However, the non-lostech parts were retained.

ST-8A, SPR-4F, CRD-1R, WVE-5Nsl, HOP-4A-B-C-D, GLH-1D and KY2-D-02:

See point â„–1 from the previous list. There's no way to buy or find parts in FP crates. I also remind you that SPR-4F can only be found in the version for BTX CAC Compatibility.

SPR-5F:

Davion and Steiner forces, their elite units and ComStar, but only after 01.01.3053 - the 5F model was put into production after this date.

RFL-2N:

Pretty common model, so literally everywhere.

KY2-D-02:

Primitive 'mech, can be found in local troops and peripheral states. Not on sale.

PLG-1N:

It's found in about the same places as the Victor models A and A1, but has a slightly lower chance of appearing. The entire 'mechs and parts for assembly can be found on the markets of the Liao and Davion Houses.

WHM-6Rk:
1) 'Mechs refitted from stock 6R into 6Rk can be encountered in battles against any troops using the Draconis Combine tables, but after the beginning of 3047. Their rarity is the same as that of the Marauder model 5D, so it is relatively rare, but not unique.
2) If you caught Colonel Lees at FP "The Long Hunt", handed him over to Renauld Yamaguchi, and also killed the defector Okada in FP "The Defector", then if you have a high reputation with House Kurita, sooner or later Yamaguchi will call you with a business proposal. You'll need a lot of money. Really a lot of money. Not as much as buying a Berserker, but the price is biting.

Now about features.

Feature 1 - Guardian ECM (X-2 ECM in stock BEX) and Beagle Active Probe (Beagle AP Equipment in stock BEX):

1) Former SLDF planets and sometimes they should be found on advanced Research planets. They may come across a little more often than necessary, but, unfortunately, there is no other way to add them, except to make them almost impossible to find;
2) BAP and Guardian ECM can drop from FP crates, provided that the crate contains lostech items.

If for some reason you don't want to see the Guardian ECM and BAP in stores, then after installing the mod, go to the BT\Mods\RoyalPack\itemCollectionsAppend folder and delete the itemCollection_shop_starleague, itemCollection_shop_starleagueProgression and itemCollection_shopItems_researchProgression_lostech files in it. To remove the electronics from the FP crates, delete the itemCollection_Upgrades_SLDF file at the same place.

Feature 2 - Hell of a Deal event fix:

Everything is quite simple - earlier in the crate from this event there could be parts of lostech 'mechs, parts of just rare mechs or weapons. I guess no one likes the shitty million C-Bill LRM rig, and the event text mentions that the reward should be the parts, so the weapons were dropped from the list of what might end up in the crate. But don't relax, there are still parts of non-lostech 'mechs in the list, so you may come across a part from some simple 'mech without lostech toys.

# Bugs:

Not noticed, but there are some things you should know.
1) 'Mechs from this list don't use their own models and icons for lack of such: Spector (Goshawk model), Pillager (Kodiak model), Kyudo (Vindicator model) and Galahad (Nova Cat model). If the CAB ever has a separate models for these 'mechs, I'll fix that. Hey, if you're on the CAB team - a lot of guys are almost praying for Pillager. Well, you get the idea :D
2) 'Mechs that don't have their own models use MechAffinity from the 'mechs whose models they are using. So don't be surprised, for example, that your Pillager pilot has the Kodiak piloting skills. Again, if there are ever separate models for these 'mechs, this will be fixed.
3) Due to the fact that BT 'mechs have fewer slots than in MegaMek, some 'mechs have their DHS partially removed from the equipment list and included in the engine cooling system. Otherwise, they won't fit. So don't worry, the cooling is okay, you just can't get these DHS through the salvage if you destroy these 'mechs. On the other hand, you won't be able to lose these DHS if the armor is destroyed and the damage goes into the structure, so in a way, this is even better.
4) The location of FF-, endo- and FF+endo slots doesn't completely coincide with the canonical one, because in BEX they require 1 slot less than in MegaMek. Not a problem, so just information.

# Permissions:

Feel free to use 'mechs from this mod in your mods or BEX add-ons. The FullXotlTables and BT_Exttended's itemCollections tables belong to Haree, MechAffinity files belong to Jamie Wolf, and all weapons and equipment used in 'mech files belong to their authors, so please contact them for the transfer of these stuff to other modifications.

# Credits:

lordruthermore - submitted the original idea, helped a lot with the list of battlemechs and Xotl balancing, and provided technical advice on their design (including most BetterMechs features) and MegaMek. He also provided source files for some 'mechs.

RJPhoenix - helped with technical questions, cooling calculations and Xotl balancing.

Xaero - gave me the idea to add Guardian ECM and BAP to stores and rewards.

Haree - he made the BEX, you know.

Jamie Wolf - files of his MechAffinity mod are using here.

Winterless - adding WHM-6Rk was his idea, so he helped to proofread the texts for this 'mech.
