# Oldtimer Pack
This mod contains several new BattleMechs including 'mechs of the Royal SLDF regiments, as well as one Helm-tech class BattleMech. Also, the mod allows you to buy Guardian ECM and Beagle Active Probe electronic systems in stores or find it in FP crates. Finally, it fixes the Hell of a Deal event, now it will be impossible to get a stupid weapon for a million of C-Bills there. This is an add-on for the BattleTech Extended: Commander's Edition 3025 mod (aka BEX) and requires it to be installed.

Current version is 1.5.1, added 22.02.2022.

From 04.14.2022, the Oldtimer Pack mod is NO LONGER MAINTAINED. All content included in mod The Big Deal for BattleTech Extended 3025â€“3061 version 1.9.3.7: https://github.com/Hounfor/The-Big-Deal-Add-On

# Compatibility:

Oldtimer Pack should be compatible with any mods and addons for BEX, provided that they don't change the internal design of battlemechs, i.e. don't add engines, actuators, etc. into mechlab. If you have installed any mod that changes the FullXotltables, then you'll have to manually transfer the data from the tables in this archive to those used in your mod assembly. For this case, there is a special folder "XotlTables - data for manual entry": it contains Xotl tables containing only new 'mechs. You'll have to transfer this data to the original Xotl manually, but the mod will work.

No new game required, the mod is compatible with current saves.

# Installation:
1) Open BT\Mods folder and copy FullXotlTables and MechAffinity folders somewhere. Then open BT\Mods\BT_Extended and repeat the procedure with the itemCollections folder and do the hame for BT_Extended_CE\MechSettings file. These will be your backups in case something goes wrong.
2) Unpack the OldtimerPack archive, open the Installation files folder, move or copy the folders BT_Extended, BT_Extended_CE, FullXotlTables, MechAffinity and OldtimerPack to the BT/Mods directory and confirm the replacement of the files.
3) This is optional step, but it definitely won't hurt the installation. Open BT\Mods\ModTek folder and run modtekinjector.exe as administrator.
4) Launch BT and have fun. Make sure no error messages appear in the main menu.

Option: If you use ANY mod that changes Xotl tables, then OldtimerPack isn't compatible with it. But you can fix it yourself: the "XotlTables - data for manual entry" folder is included in the archive especially for you. It contains Xotl tables that only include new mechs. It is USELESS to install it in your Mods folder (when you try to do this, nothing will change in the game), you'll have to transfer the data from there to your Xotl manually using the usual Windows Notepad or Notepad++. Unfortunately, this is currently the easiest way I can make the OP compatible with other Xotl-changing mods.

Where to find?

PLG-3Z, BLR-1GBc, BLR-1Gc, SPR-4F, CRD-1R, WVE-5Nsl, GLH-1D and KY2-D-02:

Find ComStar, WoB or Snord's Irregulars and kick their asses. Probably they will deploy these mechs.
Keep in mind - GLH-1D isn't a typical Galahad chassis. It's 10 tons lighter, therefore it's located in the section of medium 'mechs in the skirmish mechbay.

SPR-5F:

Davion and Steiner forces, their elite units and ComStar, but only after 01.01.3053 - the 5F model was put into production after this date.

RFL-2N:

Pretty common model, so literally everywhere. Keep in mind - this isn't a typical Rifleman chassis. It's 10 tons lighter, therefore it's located in the section of medium 'mechs in the skirmish mechbay.

KY2-D-02:

Primitive 'mech, can be found in local troops and peripheral states. Not on sale.

PLG-1N:

It's found in about the same places as the Victor models A and A1, but has a slightly lower chance of appearing. The entire 'mechs and parts for assembly can be found on the markets of the Liao and Davion Houses.

WHM-6Rk:

1) You can try to fight Kuritan elite units any time and maybe you'll find it, but the chances are extremely low until 3047.
2) 'Mechs refitted from stock 6R into 6Rk can be encountered in battles against any troops using the Draconis Combine tables, but after the beginning of 3047.
3) If you caught Colonel Lees at FP "The Long Hunt", handed him over to Renauld Yamaguchi, and also killed the defector Okada in FP "The Defector", then if you have a high reputation with House Kurita, sooner or later Yamaguchi will call you with a business proposal. You'll need a lot of money. Really a lot of money. Not as much as buying a Berserker, but the price is biting.

BLR-1Gd:

1) You can try to fight Davion elite units any time and maybe you'll find it, but the chances are extremely low until 3043.
2) 'Mechs refitted from stock 1G into 1Gd can be encountered in battles against any troops using the Federated Suns tables, but after the beginning of 3043.

BattleAxe BKX-7K, BattleAxe BKX-7NC, Hammerhands HMH-3D and Hammerhands HMH-4D:

Technically, these chassis are extinct, but occasionally they can be found in Davion local troops.

Phoenix PX-3R and Phoenix PX-4R:

Technically, these chassis are extinct, but occasionally they can be found in Steiner local troops.

Von Rohrs VON 4RH-5 and Von Rohrs VON 4RH-6:

Technically, these chassis are extinct, but occasionally they can be found in Kuritan local troops.

Archer ARC-5CS, Marauder MAR-5CS, Phoenix Hawk PXH-1bC, Rifleman RFL-5CS, Shadow Hawk SHD-2Ht and Warhammer WHM-7CS:

These all are ComStar refits used in the Battle of Tukayyid. They can be stumbled upon in missions with the participation of ComStar or WoB after 01.01.3052 with a small probability.

Annihilator ANH-1X:

I have no idea why I made it at all, because I never figured out how to integrate this into the mod without harming the lore, but let it be. It's impossible to get this 'mech in game ways, only by the save editor or mods like "Fell Of A Cargo Ship".


Now about features.

Feature 1 - Guardian ECM (X-2 ECM in stock BEX) and Beagle Active Probe (Beagle AP Equipment in stock BEX):

1) Former SLDF planets and sometimes they should be found on advanced Research planets. They may come across a little more often than necessary, but, unfortunately, there is no other way to add them, except to make them almost impossible to find;
2) BAP and Guardian ECM can drop from FP crates, provided that the crate contains lostech items.

If for some reason you don't want to see the Guardian ECM and BAP in stores, then after installing the mod, go to the BT\Mods\RoyalPack\itemCollectionsAppend folder and delete the itemCollection_shop_starleague, itemCollection_shop_starleagueProgression and itemCollection_shopItems_researchProgression_lostech files in it. To remove the electronics from the FP crates, delete the itemCollection_Upgrades_SLDF file at the same place.

Feature 2 - Hell of a Deal event fix:

Everything is quite simple - earlier in the crate from this event there could be parts of lostech 'mechs, parts of just rare mechs or weapons. I guess no one likes the shitty million C-Bill LRM rig, and the event text mentions that the reward should be the parts, so the weapons were dropped from the list of what might end up in the crate. But don't relax, there are still parts of non-lostech 'mechs in the list, so you may come across a part from some simple 'mech without lostech toys.

Feature 3 - a bit like an Easter egg:

Well, it was originally just a joke on the Clan Jade Falcon and Liao, but somebody might like it. Check the list of emblems available to the player, there is one new.

# Bugs:

Not noticed, but there are some things you should know.
1) 'Mechs from this list don't use their own models and icons for lack of such: Spector (Goshawk model), Pillager (Kodiak model), Kyudo (Vindicator model), Galahad (Nova Cat model) and Hammerhands (BattleAxe model). If the CAB ever has a separate models for these 'mechs, I'll fix that. Hey, if you're on the CAB team - a lot of guys are almost praying for Pillager. Well, you get the idea :D
2) Some 'mechs that don't have their own models (except Hammerhands due to different tonnage) use MechAffinity from the 'mechs whose models they are using. So don't be surprised, for example, that your Pillager pilot has the Kodiak piloting skills. Again, if there are ever separate models for these 'mechs, this will be fixed.
3) Due to the fact that BT 'mechs have fewer slots than in MegaMek, some 'mechs have their DHS partially removed from the equipment list and included in the engine cooling system. Otherwise, they won't fit. So don't worry, the cooling is okay, you just can't get these DHS through the salvage if you destroy these 'mechs. On the other hand, you won't be able to lose these DHS if the armor is destroyed and the damage goes into the structure, so in a way, this is even better.
4) The location of FF-, endo- and FF+endo slots doesn't completely coincide with the canonical one, because in BEX they require 1 slot less than in MegaMek. Not a problem, so just information.

# Permissions:

Feel free to use 'mechs from this mod in your mods or BEX add-ons. The FullXotlTables and BT_Exttended's itemCollections tables belong to Haree, MechAffinity files belong to Jamie Wolf, and all weapons and equipment used in 'mech files belong to their authors, so please contact them for the transfer of these stuff to other modifications.
