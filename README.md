# Oldtimer Pack (former Royal Pack)
This mod contains several new BattleMechs including 'mechs of the Royal SLDF regiments, as well as one Helm-tech class battlemech. Also, the mod allows you to buy Guardian ECM and Beagle Active Probe electronic systems in stores or find it in FP crates. Finally, it fixes the Hell of a Deal event, now it will be impossible to get a stupid weapon for a million of C-Bills there. This is an add-on for the BattleTech Extended: Commander's Edition 3025 mod (aka BEX) and requires it to be installed.

If you are looking for the Royal Pack mod, then this is it, simply due to the fact that there are quite a few 'mechs that don't belong to the SLDF Royal forces, the mod has been renamed.

Current version is 1.4.2, added 13.11.2021.

# Compatibility:

Oldtimer Pack should be compatible with any mods and addons for BEX, provided that they don't change the internal design of battlemechs, i.e. don't add engines, actuators, etc. into mechlab. If you have installed any mod that changes the FullXotltables, then you'll have to manually transfer the data from the tables in this archive to those used in your mod assembly. For this case, there is a special folder "XotlTables - data for manual entry": it contains Xotl tables containing only new 'mechs. You'll have to transfer this data to the original Xotl manually, but the mod will work.

No new game required, the mod is compatible with current saves.

# Installation:
WARNING: Don't try to install the BTX CAC Compatibility version if you don't have the mcb's BTX CAC Compatibility mod with your BEX - the game may not start!
1) FOR USERS OF PREVIOUS MOD VERSIONS ONLY, i.e. RoyalPack users: open BT\Mods folder and delete RoyalPack folder. Only this, nothing more. If you don't have RoyalPack, but OldtimerPack folder is in your Mods directory, then I recommend to delete it too, but that's not too necessary, you can just replace old files.
2) Open BT\Mods folder and copy FullXotlTables and MechAffinity folders somewhere. Then open BT\Mods\BT_Extended and repeat the procedure with the itemCollections folder. These will be your backups in case something goes wrong.
3) Unpack the OldtimerPack archive and select the appropriate version depending on whether you have the mcb's CAC Compatibility mod installed or not. Each of the versions is in the corresponding folder, you won't be mistaken :)
4) Move or copy the folders BT_Extended, FullXotlTables, MechAffinity and OldtimerPack of the appropriate version to the BT/Mods directory and confirm the replacement of the files.
5) This is optional step, but it definitely won't hurt the installation. Open BT\Mods\ModTek folder and run modtekinjector.exe as administrator.
6) Launch BT and have fun. Make sure no error messages appear in the main menu.

Option 1: Some 'mechs have shitty loadouts, design errors, and similar issues. The original versions of Oldtimer Pack add these 'mechs exactly as they are. However, if you don't like the fact that Spectors have five free armor points, Hoplite's weaponry is boring bullshit, and Pillager, in your opinion, lacks Vectored Thrust Kits to be the real horror at your battlefield, then you can install the Better Mechs patch. Just open the BetterMechs folder with the appropriate version from the archive, copy the OldtimerPack folder from there and paste it into BT\Mods with OldtimerPack folder already installed, confirming the replacement of the files. Don't forget: Better Mechs and Oldtimer Pack versions must match, i.e. for example, DO NOT install the Oldtimer Pack version for Stock BEX and patch it from the CAC version or vice versa.

Option 2: Now the mod includes a fix for the Catapults K2 and K3. Previously, these 'mechs used the default Catapult affinities, i.e. received a bonus to rocket weapons, although they couldn't use it. Now they will receive a bonus to energy weapons, but use a slightly different model from the CAB. If you want to use this fix, then copy the BEX_K2pult_fix folder from the archive into your Mods folder. Compatible with any version regardless of the presence of CAC-C.

Option 3: If you use ANY mod, except for CAC-Compatibility, that changes Xotl tables, then OldtimerPack isn't compatible with it. But you can fix it yourself: the "XotlTables - data for manual entry" folder is included in the archive especially for you. It contains Xotl tables that only include new mechs. It is USELESS to install it in your Mods folder (when you try to do this, nothing will change in the game), you'll have to transfer the data from there to your Xotl manually using the usual Windows Notepad. Unfortunately, this is currently the easiest way I can make the OP compatible with other Xotl-changing mods.

Where to find?

ARC-2Rb, SHD-2Hb, WVR-7H, and PLG-3Z:
1) Find ComStar or Snords Irregulars and kick their asses. Perhaps you are lucky and the enemy will expose these battlemechs in battle;
2) Parts can be found in stores of Former SLDF systems, so check the stores during flights;
3) Parts can drop from FP crates, provided that the crate contains lostech items;
4) Finally, the parts can be found in the Hell of a Deal event reward crate. The event has been changed: now you can't receive weapons as a reward, only 'mech parts. However, the non-lostech parts were retained.

ST-8A, SPR-4F, CRD-1R, WVE-5Nsl, HOP-4A-B-C-D, GLH-1D and KY2-D-02:

See point â„–1 from the previous list. There's no way to buy or find parts in FP crates. I also remind you that SPR-4F can only be found in the version for BTX CAC Compatibility.
Keep in mind - GLH-1D isn't a typical Galahad chassis. It's 10 tons lighter, therefore it's located in the section of medium 'mechs in the skirmish mechbay.

SPR-5F:

Davion and Steiner forces, their elite units and ComStar, but only after 01.01.3053 - the 5F model was put into production after this date.

RFL-2N:

Pretty common model, so literally everywhere. Keep in mind - this isn't a typical Rifleman chassis. It's 10 tons lighter, therefore it's located in the section of medium 'mechs in the skirmish mechbay.

KY2-D-02:

Primitive 'mech, can be found in local troops and peripheral states. Not on sale.

PLG-1N:

It's found in about the same places as the Victor models A and A1, but has a slightly lower chance of appearing. The entire 'mechs and parts for assembly can be found on the markets of the Liao and Davion Houses.

WHM-6Rk:
1) 'Mechs refitted from stock 6R into 6Rk can be encountered in battles against any troops using the Draconis Combine tables, but after the beginning of 3047. Their rarity is the same as that of the Marauder model 5D, so it is relatively rare, but not unique.
2) If you caught Colonel Lees at FP "The Long Hunt", handed him over to Renauld Yamaguchi, and also killed the defector Okada in FP "The Defector", then if you have a high reputation with House Kurita, sooner or later Yamaguchi will call you with a business proposal. You'll need a lot of money. Really a lot of money. Not as much as buying a Berserker, but the price is biting.

BattleAxe BKX-7K, BattleAxe BKX-7NC, Hammerhands HMH-3D and Hammerhands HMH-4D:

Technically, these chassis are extinct, but occasionally they can be found in Davion local troops.

Phoenir PX-3R and Phoenix PX-4R:

Technically, these chassis are extinct, but occasionally they can be found in Steiner local troops.

Von Rohrs VON 4RH-5 and Von Rohrs VON 4RH-6:

Technically, these chassis are extinct, but occasionally they can be found in Kuritan local troops.

Archer ARC-5CS, Marauder MAR-5CS, Phoenix Hawk PXH-1bC, Rifleman RFL-5CS, Shadow Hawk SHD-2Ht and Warhammer WHM-7CS:

These all are ComStar refits used in the Battle of Tukayyid. They can be stumbled upon in missions with the participation of ComStar after 01.01.3052 with a small probability. By the way, the likelihood of HSR 400-D Hussar, KGC-001 King Crab, BL-9-KNT Black Knight, CHP-3N Champion and WVE-9N Wyvern spawning as other Clanbusters has also been lowered.

Annihilator ANH-1X:

I have no idea why I made it at all, because I never figured out how to integrate this into the mod without harming the lore, but let it be. It's impossible to get this 'mech in game ways, only by the save editor or mods like "Fell Of A Cargo Ship".

Marauders II - 5A, 5B and 5C:
1) Any Marauder II users can expose these battlemechs in battle, most of them are Great Houses and their elite units, but some mercenary outfits too. Better to check Xotl for sure: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AKBWV0VBRo7cJb4YfiFFPIxhG-OTNvqJAHMmXwg-Z0E/
2) These 'mechs should have been available in the Outreach store, but I can't do this, because the code for the stores is overcomplicated and it's unrealistic for me to figure it out. Maybe someday it will be corrected, but not for now - this note just touched on a possible perspective (which may not come at all).

Now about features.

Feature 1 - Guardian ECM (X-2 ECM in stock BEX) and Beagle Active Probe (Beagle AP Equipment in stock BEX):

1) Former SLDF planets and sometimes they should be found on advanced Research planets. They may come across a little more often than necessary, but, unfortunately, there is no other way to add them, except to make them almost impossible to find;
2) BAP and Guardian ECM can drop from FP crates, provided that the crate contains lostech items.

If for some reason you don't want to see the Guardian ECM and BAP in stores, then after installing the mod, go to the BT\Mods\RoyalPack\itemCollectionsAppend folder and delete the itemCollection_shop_starleague, itemCollection_shop_starleagueProgression and itemCollection_shopItems_researchProgression_lostech files in it. To remove the electronics from the FP crates, delete the itemCollection_Upgrades_SLDF file at the same place.

Feature 2 - Hell of a Deal event fix:

Everything is quite simple - earlier in the crate from this event there could be parts of lostech 'mechs, parts of just rare mechs or weapons. I guess no one likes the shitty million C-Bill LRM rig, and the event text mentions that the reward should be the parts, so the weapons were dropped from the list of what might end up in the crate. But don't relax, there are still parts of non-lostech 'mechs in the list, so you may come across a part from some simple 'mech without lostech toys.

Feature 3 - a bit like an Easter egg:

Well, it was originally just a joke on the Clan Jade Falcon and Liao, but somebody might like it. Check the list of emblems available to the player, there is one new.

# Bugs:

Not noticed, but there are some things you should know.
1) 'Mechs from this list don't use their own models and icons for lack of such: Spector (Goshawk model), Pillager (Kodiak model), Kyudo (Vindicator model), Galahad (Nova Cat model) and Hammerhands (BattleAxe model). If the CAB ever has a separate models for these 'mechs, I'll fix that. Hey, if you're on the CAB team - a lot of guys are almost praying for Pillager. Well, you get the idea :D
2) 'Mechs that don't have their own models (except Hammerhands due to different tonnage) use MechAffinity from the 'mechs whose models they are using. So don't be surprised, for example, that your Pillager pilot has the Kodiak piloting skills. Again, if there are ever separate models for these 'mechs, this will be fixed.
3) Due to the fact that BT 'mechs have fewer slots than in MegaMek, some 'mechs have their DHS partially removed from the equipment list and included in the engine cooling system. Otherwise, they won't fit. So don't worry, the cooling is okay, you just can't get these DHS through the salvage if you destroy these 'mechs. On the other hand, you won't be able to lose these DHS if the armor is destroyed and the damage goes into the structure, so in a way, this is even better.
4) The location of FF-, endo- and FF+endo slots doesn't completely coincide with the canonical one, because in BEX they require 1 slot less than in MegaMek. Not a problem, so just information.

# Permissions:

Feel free to use 'mechs from this mod in your mods or BEX add-ons. The FullXotlTables and BT_Exttended's itemCollections tables belong to Haree, MechAffinity files belong to Jamie Wolf, and all weapons and equipment used in 'mech files belong to their authors, so please contact them for the transfer of these stuff to other modifications.

RJPhoenix - helped with technical questions, cooling calculations and Xotl balancing. Clanbusters were also his idea, and he helped significantly with some of their design problems during the development process.

Xaero - gave me the idea to add Guardian ECM and BAP to stores and rewards.

Haree - he made the BEX, you know.

Jamie Wolf - files of his MechAffinity mod are using here.

Winterless - offered to add WHM-6Rk, and helped to proofread the texts for this 'mech.

Sidika - without him there wouldn't be this new emblem.

Monomaxos - gave me the idea to make a fix for Catapults K2 and K3 and was the first to try them.

totallyrobot - sources for manual editing in Xotl were added at his request.

Waladil - fixes in Yang's thoughts to the first 18 mechs from the list.
