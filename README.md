# RoyalPack
This mod contains several new battlemechs of the Royal SLDF regiments, as well as one Helm-tech class battlemech. Also, the mod allows you to buy Guardian ECM and Beagle Active Probe electronic systems in stores or find it in FP crates. This is an add-on for the BattleTech Extended: Commander's Edition 3025 mod (aka BEX) and requires it to be installed.

# Installation:
WARNING: Don't try to install the BTX CAC Compatibility version if you don't have the mcb's BTX CAC Compatibility mod with your BEX - the game may not start!
1) Open BT\Mods folder and copy FullXotlTables somewhere. Then open BT\Mods\BT_Extended and repeat the procedure with the itemCollections folder. These will be your backups in case something goes wrong.
2) Unpack the RoyalPack archive and select the appropriate version depending on whether you have the mcb's CAC Compatibility mod installed or not. Each of the versions is in the corresponding folder, you won't be mistaken :)
3) Move or copy the folders BT_Extended, FullXotlTables and RoyalPack of the appropriate version to the BT/Mods directory and confirm the replacement of the files.
4) This is optional step, but it definitely won't hurt the installation. Open BT\Mods\ModTek folder and run modtek.exe as administrator.
5) Launch BT and have fun. Make sure no error messages appear in the main menu.

# List of 'Mechs:
1) Archer ARC-2Rb
2) Shadow Hawk SHD-2Hb
3) Wolverine II WVR-7H
4) Shootist ST-8A
5) Spector SPR-4F (included only in the version for mcb's BTX CAC Compatibility mod)
6) Spector SPR-5F (Helm-tech battlemech)

Where to find?

ARC-2Rb, SHD-2Hb and WVR-7H:
1) Find ComStar and kick their asses. Perhaps you are lucky and the enemy will expose these battlemechs in battle;
2) Parts can be found in stores of Former SLDF systems, so check stores during flights;
3) Parts can drop from FP crates, provided that the crate contains lostech items;
4) Finally, the parts can be found in the Hell of a Deal event reward crate. The event has been changed: now you can't receive weapons as a reward, only 'mech parts. However, the non-lostech parts were retained.

ST-8A and SPR-4F:

See point â„–1 from the previous list. There's no way to buy or find parts in FP crates. I also remind you that SPR-4F can only be found in the version for BTX CAC Compatibility.

SPR-5F:

Davion and Steiner forces, their elite units and ComStar, but only after 01.01.3053 - the 5F model was put into production after this date.

Guardian ECM (X-2 ECM in stock BEX) and Beagle Active Probe (Beagle AP Equipment in stock BEX):

1) Former SLDF planets and sometimes they should be found on advanced Research planets. They may come across a little more often than necessary, but, unfortunately, there is no other way to add them, except to make them almost impossible to find;
2) BAP and Guardian ECM can drop from FP crates, provided that the crate contains lostech items.

If for some reason you don't want to see the Guardian ECM and BAP in stores, then after installing the mod, go to the BT\Mods\RoyalPack\itemCollectionsAppend folder and delete the itemCollection_shop_starleague, itemCollection_shop_starleagueProgression and itemCollection_shopItems_researchProgression_lostech files in it. To remove the electronics from the FP crates, delete the itemCollection_Upgrades_SLDF file at the same place.

# Bugs:

Not noticed, but there are some things you should know.
1) Spector uses a scaled-down model of Goshawk, aka Vapor Eagle, and its icon. If the CAB ever has a separate model for the Spector, I'll fix that.
2) Due to the fact that BT battlemechs have fewer slots than in MegaMek, the Shootist's 13th and Spector's 10th DHS were removed from the list of equipment and included in the engine cooling system. Otherwise they don't fit. So everything is fine with cooling, you just won't be able to get these two DHS through the salvage if you destroy these 'mechs.
3) The location of FF-, endo- and FF+endo slots doesn't completely coincide with the canonical one, because in BEX they require 1 slot less than in MegaMek. Not a problem, so just information.

# Compatibility:

Royal Pack should be compatible with any mods and addons for BEX, provided that they don't change the internal design of battlemechs, i.e. don't add engines, actuators, etc. into mechlab. If you have installed any mod that changes the SL_Royal table in FullXotltables, then you'll have to manually transfer the data from the table in this archive to the one used in your mod assembly.

No new game required. The mod is also compatible with current saves.

# Permissions:

Feel free to use 'mechs from this mod in your mods or BEX add-ons. The SL_Royal table belongs to Haree, and all weapons and equipment used in 'mech files belong to their authors, so please contact them for the transfer of this hardware to other modifications.
